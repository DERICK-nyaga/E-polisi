            <p id="para">This type of system is a from of something called distributed ledger.It uses multiple computers or servers to store records.Once a record has been committed it cannot be altered.<br>
            An officer must be logged in first as to access pages for recording statements and viewing cases that have been reported.<br>
            Only the senior officers can assign other police officers cases and duties to perform.The OB number its generate automatically by the system meaning that it does not have to be assigned by the officer on duty.<br>The OB number will be a ten digit number and it will be stored in a blockchain format meaning that it is immutable or cannot be changed.<br>Not even the Inspector General of police can alter it up.<br>This means that the system is much secure since criminal records cannot be altered by anybody.<br>After using the system make sure you logout or else it will log you out automatically once your session is expired.
