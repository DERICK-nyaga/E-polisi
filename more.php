        <p>This is a police system that stores all the records of both civilian criminals and also those rogue police officers who are deemed to be criminals by the law.
            Any criminal record here is inserted in a blockchain format where it is nearly tamper proof meaning that once a record is inserted in the database it cannot be deleted.
            There are those records that sre deemed to be permanent and others semipermanent. In permanent they are recorded in red and in semipermanent blue or black is allowed.
